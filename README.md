Angular Version: 17
Note:
I have uploaded only src's and important files of project. You have to replace your src's when you download new project. Steps to do so:
1. ng new projectname --no-standalone OR ng new projectname.
2. Delete an existing src from your project folder.
3. Replace with src I have uploaded on Git.
4. Run the project: ng serve --o OR ng serve
